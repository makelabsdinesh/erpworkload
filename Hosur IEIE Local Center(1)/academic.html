                    <p>As notified by the Government of India, passing of Sections A & B Examination of the Institution is equivalent to a degree in engineering in the respective discipline. The qualification is accepted by the central academic organizations, e.g. IITs and also by central recruitment agencies, e.g. UPSC.</p>
                    <h3>These examinations are mainly opted by:</h3>
                    <p>The diploma engineers for their career advancement</p>
                    <h3>Sections A and B examination consist of:

                    <h2>IEI Accreditation</h2>

                    <p>At present, India is at an irreversible point of distinguished and extensive technological advancement. Multifarious Engineering and Technology subjects, integrating science with engineering have created a demand for contemporary engineering and technological education throughout the country and have consequently brought in new faces for sustainable and rapid development. There is a continuous demand on higher engineering education to survive the fast infusion of globalization in the economy, brisk technological advances in various fields of engineering, the emergence of new technologies, and the ever-increasing knowledge and research in every field. In India, problems are acute due to large-scale expansion of degree-level education, particularly through privately-managed institutions, the growing obsolescence of teaching, training equipment, and methodologies. Therefore, setting quality standards for the educational process has become utmost important. Standardization should not mean discouragement to innovative educational methodologies or curbing of individual institutional initiatives, but setting up required benchmark by all institutions in a time-bound manner to attain desired quality standards in line with National and Global requirements. IEI accreditation will make college/Institute ready for all statutory and non statutory compliance, system and process in order and addressing the technical education issues in national and global perspective. It is an indicator that Colleges/Institutions can consider further to go for NBA (Tier-I) accreditation. Hence, IEI accreditation shall truly be a take-off point in NBA accreditation.</p>

                    <h3>History of IEI Accreditation</h3>
                    <p>The Institution started recognising different engineering disciplines back in 1939 with the course of B.Sc (Eng.) conducted at the then Punjab University. IEI virtually acted as the agency on behalf of the Government, State Governments, Industries, etc. for accreditation of engineering curricula. IEI has accredited over 1200 courses in more 400 leading engineering colleges including IIT(s), Regional Engineering Colleges (now NITs), Deemed universities, Defence establishments, Private engineering colleges and others.
                        The Institution continued the task for recognition of degree and diploma level Engineering programs till formation of AICTE in 1987 and NBA in 1994, respectively came into existence. After AICTE came into existence and given the statutory powers by the Ministry of Human Resource Development for approval of degree/diploma programmes before starting such courses.</p>

                        <h3>Why IEI Accreditation </h3>
                        <p>Accreditation is mandatory for quality assurance. The Institution, as one of the premier bodies for Accreditation of Engineering courses in the country having vast and varied experience in this field for the last 8 decades, wide network of its state/local centres and over 1.80 lac Corporate members, including well known academicians is the only professional body in India who can take up this voluntary gigantic task. The Institution has already a grave confidence in this field with professionalism. It is not out of the place to mention that in most of the countries accreditation of engineering program is being dealt by a professional body. Therefore, IEI can play a significant role to achieve the objective of voluntary accreditation of Engineering/Technology programs.</p>
